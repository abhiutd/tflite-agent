This is the Tensorflow Lite agent for [MLModelScope](mlmodelscope.org), an open-source framework and hardware agnostic, extensible and customizable platform for evaluating and profiling ML models across datasets / frameworks / systems, and within AI application pipelines. It is used to deploy mobile devices through MLModelScope ecosystem.

Currently it has most of the models from Tensorflow Lite  Model Zoo built in, plus many models acquired from public repositories. Although the agent supports different modalities including Object Detection and Image Enhancement, most of the built-in models are for Image Classification. More built-in models are coming.
One can evaluate the **~50** models on any mobile device of interest as long as MLModelScope Mobile Agent is deployed on it.  

Check out [MLModelScope](mlmodelscope.org) and welcome to contribute.

Note: rest of the documentation to be added.
